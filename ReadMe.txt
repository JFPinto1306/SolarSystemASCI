Why not something that takes a date and displays the position of the planets on that date as ASCII in the terminal?


/*
Thought organizer:
1 - determine the formula to compute each planets elipse (including semi-major-axis, period and eccentricity);
2 - find perihelion date to find the step 0
3 - Find step 0 x,y coordinates
4 - create function to determine planet x,y position based on time difference vs perihelion
