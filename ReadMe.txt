Why not something that takes a date and displays the position of the planets on that date as ASCII in the terminal? - Gabriel Tocha, 05-05-2025


/*
Thought organizer:
[Done] 1 - Determine the formula to compute each planets elipse (including semi-major-axis, period and eccentricity);
[Done] 2 - Find perihelion date to find the step 0;
[Done] 3 - Find step 0 x,y coordinates (simplified approach for eccentricty anomaly);
4 - Create function to determine planet x,y position based on time difference vs perihelion -> Function done pending date diff;
5 - Export planet coordinates to other file;
6 - ASCII representation of the grid;
